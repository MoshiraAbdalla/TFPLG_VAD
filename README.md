# TFPLG: Training-Free VLM-Based Pseudo Label Generation for Video Anomaly Detection

This repository contains the official implementation of our IEEE Access paper on **Training-Free Pseudo Label Generation (TFPLG)** using vision-language models (CLIP) for Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection (WSVAD).

## üìä Framework Overview

![TFPLG Framework](./TFPLG_framework.png)

The figure above illustrates the overall framework of our method, which includes:

- (A) CLIP Feature Extraction for both vision and text modalities.
- (B) Vision Branch for binary classification using a transformer and GCN.
- (C) Fine-grained Classification Branch with visual prompt interaction.
- (D) Pseudo Label Generation Branch that aligns normal-guided textual embeddings with visual features.

## üîß Setup Instructions

### 1. Feature Preparation

To run or train the model, you will need pre-extracted features:

- **XD-Violence and UCF-Crime features**:  
  Please visit the VADCLIP repository (https://github.com/nwpu-zxr/VadCLIP) and follow their instructions to download:
  - XDTestClipFeatures and XDTrainClipFeatures
  - UCFClipFeatures

- **MSAD features**:  
  You can download them from the following link:

Save all features under a folder named `src/Features/`:

Save the downloaded model files under:

src/model/



## ‚úÖ Running the Model

### UCF-Crime Evaluation

To test the pretrained model on UCF-Crime:

python ucf_test.py


To train the model from scratch on UCF-Crime:

python ucf_train_80.py



You can configure various training and testing settings by editing the corresponding option files:

- `ucf_option.py` for UCF-Crime
- `xd_option.py` for XD-Violence
- `MSAD_option.py` for MSAD
