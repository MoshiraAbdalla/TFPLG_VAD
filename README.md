# TFPLG: Training-Free VLM-Based Pseudo Label Generation for Video Anomaly Detection

This repository contains the official implementation of our IEEE Access paper on **Training-Free Pseudo Label Generation (TFPLG)** using vision-language models (CLIP) for Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection (WSVAD).

## üìä Framework Overview

![TFPLG Framework](./TFPLG_framework.png)

The figure above illustrates the overall framework of our method, which includes:

- (A) CLIP Feature Extraction for both vision and text modalities.
- (B) Vision Branch for binary classification using a transformer and GCN.
- (C) Fine-grained Classification Branch with visual prompt interaction.
- (D) Pseudo Label Generation Branch that aligns text descriptions with video segments to refine frame-level labels.

## üîß Setup Instructions

### 1. Feature Preparation

To run or train the model, you will need pre-extracted features:

- **XD-Violence and UCF-Crime features**:  
  Please visit the VADCLIP repository (https://github.com/nwpu-zxr/VadCLIP) and follow their instructions to download:
  - XDTestClipFeatures and XDTrainClipFeatures
  - UCFClipFeatures

- **MSAD features**:  
  You can download them from the following link:

Save all features under a folder named `src/Features/`:

UCF_Crime [https://1drv.ms/u/c/2341e8a43b5b6eef/ERPQRgHNTS5DoDgW7QvrWksBKhRkpIm1LrUp1FIznXVLCA?e=ytCriZ]

Save the downloaded model files under:


```python 
src/model/
```

## ‚úÖ Running the Model

### üß™ UCF-Crime Evaluation

To test the pretrained model on UCF-Crime:

```python 
python ucf_test.py
```
To train the model from scratch on UCF-Crime:

```python
python ucf_train.py
```
### üß™ XD-Violence Training and Testing
To train the model on XD-Violence:

```python

python xd_train.py
```
To test the pretrained model on XD-Violence:

```python
python xd_test.py
```
##üß™ MSAD Evaluation
To test the model on the MSAD dataset:

```python

python MSAD_test.py
```

You can configure various training and testing settings by editing the corresponding option files:

- `ucf_option.py` for UCF-Crime
- `xd_option.py` for XD-Violence
- `MSAD_option.py` for MSAD
